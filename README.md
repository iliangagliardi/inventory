# Inventory application
Re-platforming Exercise
Transform this spring-boot rest api application from being based on SQL Server to MongoDB.


# Install SQL Server
Windows VM or Docker

# Create the database
In src/resources there is the schema.sql script that will create the database.
Two tables, Inventory and Purchases, are bi-temporal. 

# Launch the application

# Test it
Under src/test/resources there is the Postman collection with all the rest api calls to:
 - setup the inventory
 - place an order
 - change the state of an order
 - report and data query
 
# Re-platform
